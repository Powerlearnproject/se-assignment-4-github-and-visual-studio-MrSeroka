GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate tasks within your software development workflows. It enables you to build, test and deploy your code directly from your GitHub repository.

GitHub Actions uses YAML files to define workflows, which are a series of steps that are executed when certain events occur. These events can include pushes to a repository, pull requests or other repository activities.

GitHub Actions used to automate tasks :

Continuous Integration (CI) - automatically building and testing your code whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

Continuous Deployment (CD) - automatically deploying your code to a server or platform when it passes the CI tests.

Scheduled tasks - running tasks on a schedule, such as nightly backups or database maintenance.

Example of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:

Create a Workflow File: Create a .github/workflows/main.yml file in your repository to define the workflow.

Define Workflow Steps: Define the steps for the workflow, such as installing dependencies, running tests and deploying the application.

Example:
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
push:
branches:
- main

jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- name: Checkout code
uses: actions/checkout@v2

- name: Set up Node.js
uses: actions/setup-node@v1
with: node-version: '14'

- name: Install dependencies
run: npm install

- name: Run tests
run: npm test

- name: Build and deploy
run: |
npm run build


Commit and Push: Commit the workflow file to your repository and push it to trigger the workflow.
View Workflow Execution: You can view the workflow execution and logs in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
This example sets up a workflow that runs on every push to the main branch, installs dependencies, runs tests, and builds the application. You can extend this example to include deployment steps to platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku based on your specific requirements.
